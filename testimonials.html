        <p id="u1152-2">When I first started working with Ralph he simply asked me what my goal was. I let him know I wanted to tone but really concentrate on getting a flat stomach and lifting my butt. I also told him of my concerns with a past injury and my issues with asthma. Ralph came up with a mix of basic and creative exercises every session that worked to completely heal my injury, tone my body and improve my breathing. Even though the workouts were amazing and I saw results immediately, I honestly would not adhere to his suggestions when it came to my diet. When I decided to really live healthy, I followed a great meal plan he suggested, trained with him and did extra cardio at least twice a week. Ralph put me in the BEST shape I have ever been in all my life. Because of him and me continuing to take his food and workout suggestions and incorporate them in my daily workout plan, my breathing is still great and I have been able to maintain a toned/firm body. He made sure I was in the best shape possible before my last session with him. I look forward to the day I get engaged. Ralph will be one of the first people I call to get me “wedding dress” ready! Thank you for everything. You truly were a blessing to me.</p>

         <p id="u1153-2">I found out about Ralph though a friend of mine who he previously trained. She had great success from him! She lost a total of 30lbs, so I thought I would give him a try. Boy O boy! The first day I met Ralph, he was nothing but first class. We went over my goals and he also gave me some goals which challenged me more. We did our assessment and I almost didn’t go back because I was that out of shape. From day 1, he took his time with me. He pushed me hard enough to still fell the burn but not overwork me to where I couldn’t walk like you hear about other trainers. He is very understanding. I was 215 and I’m 5’6, I lost 35lbs, dropped 10% body fat, and my stomach went down 6in!!! I did all this in 3 months. He taught me a lifestyle. I continue to train on my own because I had to transfer jobs out of state. Ralph educated me on how to really workout on my own. I love this man and owe him everything. I refuse to go back. It is too bad I had to move. I think I would have him as a trainer for the rest of my life!</p>

         <p>&quot;After finding Fitted 4 Fitness website via a Google search for personal trainers, I've been training with him for about 9 months now. When I initially contacted Ralph about training, I didn't necessarily know what to expect, but now looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. My initial goals were to lose weight, and to learn ways to make my workouts more efficient and effective. Ralph has helped me achieve those goals and so much more. I have increased my overall level of fitness while becoming stronger, leaner, healthier and much happier with myself. On top of all that, Dan's training even helped me to complete a triathlon! Ralph's workouts are always different, challenging and fun, which makes me look forward to every training session with him. I would highly recommend Ralph as a trainer for anyone who wants to lose weight, improve their overall health/fitness, or just to get new ideas for more challenging and effective workouts. Training with Ralph is an investment in your health and fitness that you won't regret!&quot;</p>

       <p>&quot;I could not be more pleased with how I feel and the changes in my body since I have started working out with Ralph. My agility has improved tremendously and getting in and out of chairs is no longer a chore. Every day I am walking further and I have much less pain in my legs and my back.</p>
       <p>I actually look forward to my workouts and seeing Ralph is always a pleasure. Thank you Ralph, for my new healthy lifestyle.</p>
       <p>I feel so much better about myself these days and I give Ralph all the credit. His workouts are varied, interesting and tailored to my strengths, my weaknesses and my needs. My bad knee has been strengthened with much gentleness, yet much progress is being made.&quot;</p>

       <p>&quot;I am a client of personal trainer, Ralph Barber. I am close to 57 years old, a juvenile diabetic, a cardiac patient and have high blood pressure obesity. My blood sugars always ran high, my back was in constant pain and I was always feeling run down and weak. I knew that I had to do something. I have seen a lot of personal trainers and they seem to make everyone do the same routine over and over again, and then I met Ralph.</p>
       <p>Ralph is a vault of knowledge and has customized my training to me and my physical needs. I was obese and I had no strength at all. My body was at its weakest point when I began. Ralph doesn't give up on you and he cares.</p>
       <p>Within a few months my whole life has turned around with healthy eating habits and working out with Ralph two times a week. Not only have I lost pounds, but more importantly a lot of inches. My blood sugars are the best that they have ever been and I only take 1/3 the amount of insulin that I used to take. I no longer have high blood pressure or backaches. I now take my dogs on long walks without getting winded, whereas before I could barely walk from my car to the gym's front door without sitting down to catch my breath. I haven't felt this good since I was in my twenty's. I get stronger day after day.</p>
       <p>Ralph has not only given me my health back, but he saved my life. All trainers cost relatively the same, give or take a couple of dollars, but if it's the best trainer that you are looking for, Ralph is the one. No one can ever put a price on your health, and with Ralph you are getting your money's worth.</p>
       <p>At this point, Ralph is not only my personal trainer, but I also consider him a good friend. I look forward to many healthy years training with him.&quot;</p>
